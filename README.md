# Description

Building a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-freiendly web interface to allow partners banks and users to conduct financial transcations money transfer between senders and receivers to verify the intergrity of the data in the ledger.

The sections of this project are as follows:

Step 1 - Create a new Record data class.
Step 2 - Modify the existing Block data class to store Record data
Step 3 - Add relevant user inputs to the Streamlit application interface.
Step 4 - Test the Pychain ledger by storing records. Demonstrate the functionality of the tool.

# Test the PyChain ledger by storing records

The following screenshots demonstrates the application working with multiple stored blocks in the leder, as well as verifying the integrity of the ledger. Utilizing the Block inspector Drop-down Menu on the left of the application, the user can view specific block contents and terminal validation.
